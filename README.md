# ChiselStore (with OmniPaxos)

ChiselStore is an embeddable, distributed [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for Rust, powered by [Little Raft](https://github.com/andreev-io/little-raft).

SQLite is a fast and compact relational database management system, but it is limited to single-node configurations.
ChiselStore extends SQLite to run on a cluster of machines with the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io).
With ChiselStore, you get the benefits of easy-to-use, embeddable SQLite but with Raft's high availability and fault tolerance.

For more information, check out the following [blog post](https://glaubercosta-11125.medium.com/winds-of-change-in-web-data-728187331f53).

**At this repository Raft has been replaced by [OmniPaxos](https://github.com/haraldng/omnipaxos), a replicated log library implemented in Rust.**
## Features

* SQLite with Raft's high availability and fault tolerance
* Strong consistency with optional relaxed reads
* Embeddable Rust library

### Roadmap

* Efficient node restarts (with Raft snapshots)
* Dynamic cluster membership (with Raft joint consensus)
* Support executing non-deterministic SQL functions

## Getting Started

See the [example server](examples) of how to use the ChiselStore library.
